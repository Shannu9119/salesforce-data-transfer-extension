## Features

- **Multi-Org Support**: Seamlessly work with multiple authenticated Salesforce orgs
- **Relationship Awareness**: Automatically detect and handle object relationships during transfer
- **Batch Processing**: Configurable batch sizes for optimal performance
- **Interactive UI**: User-friendly webview panel for managing data transfers
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live progress tracking and error reporting
- **Salesforce CLI Integration**: Leverages existing Salesforce CLI authentication

### Key Capabilities

- Transfer records between any authenticated Salesforce orgs
- Preserve lookup relationships and dependencies
- Handle standard and custom objects
- Batch processing for large datasets
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Tree view of available Salesforce orgs

## Requirements

- **Salesforce CLI**: Must be installed and configured
- **Authenticated Orgs**: Source and target orgs must be authenticated via Salesforce CLI
- **VS Code**: Version 1.104.0 or higher

### Installing Salesforce CLI

```bash
# Install Salesforce CLI
npm install -g @salesforce/cli

# Authenticate with your orgs
sf org login web --alias myorg
```

## Usage

### 1. Authenticate Salesforce Orgs

Before using the extension, ensure you have authenticated orgs via Salesforce CLI:

```bash
# Authenticate source org
sf org login web --alias source-org

# Authenticate target org  
sf org login web --alias target-org
```

### 2. Open Data Transfer Panel

- Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`)
- Search for "Salesforce Data Transfer: Open Data Transfer Panel"
- Or use the Activity Bar to access the Salesforce Data Transfer view

### 3. Configure Transfer

1. **Select Organizations**: Choose your source and target orgs from the dropdown
2. **Load Objects**: Click "Load Objects" to fetch available objects from the source org
3. **Select Objects**: Choose which objects to transfer
4. **Set Options**: Configure relationship handling and batch size
5. **Start Transfer**: Click "Start Transfer" to begin the data migration

### 4. Monitor Progress

- View real-time progress in the transfer log
- Monitor successful transfers and any errors
- Review summary statistics upon completion

## Commands

- `sf-data-transfer.openTransferPanel`: Open the main data transfer interface
- `sf-data-transfer.refreshOrgs`: Refresh the list of authenticated orgs
- `sf-data-transfer.selectSourceOrg`: Quick select source org from command palette
- `sf-data-transfer.selectTargetOrg`: Quick select target org from command palette

## Views

- **Salesforce Orgs**: Tree view showing all authenticated Salesforce orgs in the Explorer panel

## Known Issues

- Currently uses mock JSForce implementation - full Salesforce API integration coming soon
- Large datasets may require multiple batch operations
- Complex relationship hierarchies may need manual ordering
